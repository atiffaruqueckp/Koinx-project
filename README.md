Develop a Server Side Application to fetch Crypto Transactions of a user
Mandatory Tasks:-
Task 1:
1. Develop an API using Node.js to fetch the crypto transactions of a user.
2. You can use the Etherscan API(https://docs.etherscan.io/api-endpoints/accounts) to fetch the list
of “Normal” transactions for a user. You can use this address for testing:-
0xce94e5621a5f7068253c42558c147480f38b5e0d. You will have to create your own free API
Key for testing purposes.
3. The input for the API will be the address of a user. The output would be the list of transactions for
this address. You would also have to store these transactions against this address in a database,
preferably MongoDB.
Task 2:
1. Build a system within the same server to fetch the price of Ethereum every 10 minutes and store
it in the database.
2. You can use this API for the same:- https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?
ids=ethereum&vs_currencies=inr
Task 3:
1. Develop a `GET` API for a user where they give their address as an input and get their current
balance and current price of ether as output.
2. The balance should be calculated from the transactions of the user. If the “from” address is of the
user, the “value” property gets added to the user’s balance. If the “to” address is of the user, the
“value” property gets deducted from the user’s balance. These transactions are the ones that
were fetched in the previous tasks.
Please host your code on GitHub.
Optional Tasks:-
1. Deploy your database using MongoDB Atlas or other similar tools.
2. Deploy your backend using platforms like Heroku or any cloud platform like AWS, GCP or Azure
and expose the API to the public.
Notes:-
1. Think of this assignment as a production grade project. Using best practices, writing clean code
etc. will fetch you additional points.
2. Do think well about how you want to design your database schemas.
Once you’re done with the task, please send over the GitHub and Deployed Link(if done) to
guna@koinx.com with the subject `Backend Interview Task - <Your Name>`.
